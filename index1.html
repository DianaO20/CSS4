        Bees are winged insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their roles in pollination and, in the case
        of the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey. Bees are a monophyletic lineage
        within the superfamily Apoidea. They are currently considered a clade, called Anthophila. There are over 20,000
        known species of bees in seven recognized biological families.

        Bees feed on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein
        and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for their larvae. Vertebrate predators of bees include primates
        and birds such as bee-eaters; insect predators include beewolves and dragonflies.

        Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially, and the decline in wild bees has increased the
        value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees. The analysis of 353 wild bee and hoverfly
        species across Britain from 1980 to 2013 found the insects have been lost from a quarter of the places they
        inhabited in 1980.
