    <h1 class="h1">Leonardo da Vinci</h1>
    <p class="p1">Born out of wedlock to a successful notary and a lower-class woman in, or near, Vinci, he was educated
        in Florence by the Italian painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio. He began his career in the city, but then
        spent much time in the service of Ludovico Sforza in Milan. Later, he worked in Florence and Milan again, as
        well as briefly in Rome, all while attracting a large following of imitators and students. Upon the invitation
        of Francis I, he spent his last three years in France, where he died in 1519. Since his death, there has not
        been a time where his achievements, diverse interests, personal life, and empirical thinking have failed to
        incite interest and admiration</p>
    <h1 class="h2">Michelangelo</h1>
    <p2 class="p2 ">Michelangelo achieved fame early; two of his best-known works, the Pietà and David, were sculpted
        before the age of thirty. Although he did not consider himself a painter, Michelangelo created two of the most
        influential frescoes in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel
        in Rome, and The Last Judgment on its altar wall. His design of the Laurentian Library pioneered Mannerist
        architecture.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Gustav Klimt</h1>
    <p3 class="p3 ">Early in his career, he was a successful painter of architectural decorations in a conventional
        manner. As he began to develop a more personal style, his work was the subject of controversy that culminated
        when the paintings he completed around 1900 for the ceiling of the Great Hall of the University of Vienna were
        criticized as pornographic. He subsequently accepted no more public commissions, but achieved a new success with
        the paintings of his "golden phase", many of which include gold leaf. Klimt's work was an important influence on
        his younger peer Egon Schiele.</p>
    <h1 class="h4">Pablo Picasso</h1>
    <p class="p4">Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic
        manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as
        he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the older artist
        Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two
        artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.</p>
    <h1 class="h5">Claude Monet</h1>
    <p class="p5 ">Monet was raised in Le Havre, Normandy, and became interested in the outdoors and drawing from an
        early age. Although his mother, Louise-Justine Aubrée Monet, supported his ambitions to be a painter, his
        father, Claude-Adolphe, disapproved and wanted him to pursue a career in business. He was very close to his
        mother, but she died in January 1857 when he was sixteen years old, and he was sent to live with his childless,
        widowed but wealthy aunt, Marie-Jeanne Lecadre. He went on to study at the Académie Suisse, and under the
        academic history painter Charles Gleyre, where he was a classmate of Auguste Renoir. His early works include
        landscapes, seascapes, and portraits, but attracted little attention.</p>
